My modified version of the Jave Library (http://www.sauronsoftware.it/projects/jave/).

This is the version that I plan to use for the Panther Media Converter Project (https://github.com/sankha93/Panther).

Currently this adds capability to convert a video from a URL resource rather than just a local file.

Original Jave Library was developed by Carlo Pelliccia (cpelliccia@sauronsoftware.it)
